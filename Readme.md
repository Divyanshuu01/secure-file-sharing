# File Management API

 HI!!!! I'm Tanishque Sharma 

## Overview

The File Management API is a FastAPI application that allows users to manage files through a secure client-server architecture. It supports user authentication, file uploads, downloads, and listing of uploaded files. The application leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access control.

## Features

- User registration (sign-up)
- User login with token-based authentication
- Upload files to the server
- List uploaded files
- Download files from the server
- Secure file management

## Technologies Used

- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL (or any other database you choose)
- Python
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Pydantic for data validation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL)


### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd file-management-api
pip install -r requirements.txt

add .env variables  to your requirements
